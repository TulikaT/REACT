REACT is a javascript library used to build frontend web apps. 
react makes developing web app easy

there are two ways to create react apps:-

1. custom react app using command "create-react-app"
   disadvantage: it installs unwanted files, thus makes it bulky
   these have .js files for functionality implementation
   create is an utility

2. build using bundlers such as vite, webpack 
   these have .jsx files which include html within javascript
