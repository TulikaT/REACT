REACT is a javascript library used to build frontend web apps. 
react makes developing web app easy

There are two ways to create react apps:-

1. Custom react app using command "create-react-app"

   create is an utility

2. Build using bundlers such as vite, webpack 
   these have .jsx files which include html within javascript
